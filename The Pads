I wrote two SQL queries for this challenge to generate the required results.

## SQL QUERIES

As a database, I chose to use MySQL.

```bash
  SELECT CONCAT(NAME,'(',SUBSTR(OCCUPATION,1,1),')') AS N
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY N;
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(OCCUPATION),' ',LOWER(OCCUPATION),'s.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION;
```
